THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS APP IS PART OF THE BACKEND ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT OF THE DEVCAREER TECH BOOTCAMP

This App would help people safely share content on social media by scrambling
portions of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste
some content into a form field and then specify the words that must be scrambled
(using another field). Note that the user can specify more than one word (separated
by space) to be scrambled.

After clicking a “Redact Now” button, the app scans through the original text and
replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ****).

Some featurs of this App include:
- Allow the user to specify what to use in replacing the words so that the app can
do the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, question marks,
dashes, underscores, or even other words.

- Display stats like how many words were scanned, how many matched the words
to be scrambled, how many characters were scrambled in total etc.
